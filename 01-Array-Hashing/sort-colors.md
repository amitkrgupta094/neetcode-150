# [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/)

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm" target="_blank">in-place</a> ** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

**Follow up:** Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using onlyconstant extra space?


```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
 */
var sortColors = function(nums) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b)
    return nums;
};
```
